create a vite application with name color-game.
follow the below conditions and create the the game
build 4 blocks (normal div with width 140px height 140px) overall padding 40px
each block should be at each corner of the screen.
create a circle in the center with dimension (300 x 300)px
each block should have a click lisener, when clicked open a form / modal in the center
the form should contain a input field where user can enter a hex code as value. have a submit button inside the same form.
when submit button clicked set the hex color to the block(use usestate for each block to store the color)
the color should to reflected to the blocks once a color is set.
a user can change the color of the block as much he likes
after all blocks(color) are set a new button should appear below the circle.
once we click the button the circle should transition between all the colors from top left to bottom right.(bit hard)
have a reset button to reset everything.
states are very important to make this functional

have one state to toggle the button below the circle.
have one state to open modal/form
use id to set the value to individual blocks.
